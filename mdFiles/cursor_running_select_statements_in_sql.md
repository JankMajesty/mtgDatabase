**User**

can we run some select statements in sqlite3 in terminal on my database?

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you run some SELECT statements on your SQLite database through the terminal. First, let me examine your project to understand the database structure and see what data we're working with.

Perfect! I can see you have a SQLite database file called `mtg_database.db` with a Magic: The Gathering card database. Based on the schema, you have several tables including:

- `Card` (main cards table)
- `Artist`, `Rarity`, `CardSet`, `Color`, `CardType`, `SubType` (lookup tables)
- Junction tables for many-to-many relationships

Let me show you how to connect to your database and run some SELECT statements in the terminal:

## Connecting to the Database

First, navigate to your project directory and open the SQLite database:

```bash
cd /Users/jankmajesty/Desktop/dbProj/mtgdb
sqlite3 mtg_database.db
```

## Useful SQLite Commands

Once you're in the SQLite shell, here are some helpful commands:

```sql
-- Show all tables
.tables

-- Show schema for a specific table
.schema Card

-- Show all table schemas
.schema

-- Turn on headers and column mode for better readability
.headers on
.mode column
```

## Sample SELECT Statements

Here are some interesting queries you can run:

### 1. Basic card information
```sql
-- Get first 10 cards with basic info
SELECT CardID, CardName, ManaCost, ConvertedManaCost 
FROM Card 
LIMIT 10;
```

### 2. Cards with their sets
```sql
-- Get cards with their set information
SELECT c.CardName, cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate
FROM Card c
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
LIMIT 10;
```

### 3. Cards with their artists
```sql
-- Get cards with artist names
SELECT c.CardName, a.ArtistName
FROM Card c
JOIN Artist a ON c.ArtistID = a.ArtistID
LIMIT 10;
```

### 4. Cards by rarity
```sql
-- Count cards by rarity
SELECT r.RarityName, COUNT(*) as CardCount
FROM Card c
JOIN Rarity r ON c.RarityID = r.RarityID
GROUP BY r.RarityName
ORDER BY CardCount DESC;
```

### 5. Expensive cards (high mana cost)
```sql
-- Find cards with high converted mana cost
SELECT CardName, ManaCost, ConvertedManaCost
FROM Card
WHERE ConvertedManaCost >= 7
ORDER BY ConvertedManaCost DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 6. Cards with specific colors
```sql
-- Find red cards
SELECT DISTINCT c.CardName, c.ManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
JOIN Color col ON cc.ColorID = col.ColorID
WHERE col.Color = 'Red'
LIMIT 10;
```

### 7. Cards by type
```sql
-- Find creature cards
SELECT DISTINCT c.CardName, c.Power, c.Toughness
FROM Card c
JOIN Card_CardType cct ON c.CardID = cct.CardID
JOIN CardType ct ON cct.CardTypeID = ct.CardTypeID
WHERE ct.TypeName = 'Creature'
AND c.Power IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 10;
```

### 8. Complex query with multiple joins
```sql
-- Get detailed card information with all related data
SELECT 
    c.CardName,
    c.ManaCost,
    c.ConvertedManaCost,
    a.ArtistName,
    r.RarityName,
    cs.SetName,
    cs.SetCode
FROM Card c
JOIN Artist a ON c.ArtistID = a.ArtistID
JOIN Rarity r ON c.RarityID = r.RarityID
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
ORDER BY c.ConvertedManaCost DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**User**

can we find the average converted mana cost for green cards from each set?

---

**Cursor**

Absolutely! I'll help you create a query to find the average converted mana cost for green cards from each set. Let me construct the SQL query that joins the necessary tables to get this information.

Here's the SQL query you can run in your SQLite terminal:

```sql
-- Find average converted mana cost for green cards by set
SELECT 
    cs.SetName,
    cs.SetCode,
    cs.ReleaseDate,
    COUNT(*) as GreenCardCount,
    ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 2) as AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
JOIN Color col ON cc.ColorID = col.ColorID
WHERE col.Color = 'Green'
AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cs.SetID, cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;
```

To run this:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory:
```bash
cd /Users/jankmajesty/Desktop/dbProj/mtgdb
```

2. Connect to your SQLite database:
```bash
sqlite3 mtg_database.db
```

3. Set up nice formatting:
```sql
.headers on
.mode column
```

4. Run the query above.

This query will show you:
- **SetName**: The full name of the set
- **SetCode**: The abbreviated set code
- **ReleaseDate**: When the set was released
- **GreenCardCount**: How many green cards are in that set
- **AvgManaCost**: The average converted mana cost for green cards in that set (rounded to 2 decimal places)

The results are ordered by average mana cost (highest first), so you'll see which sets have the most expensive green cards on average.

If you want to see only sets with a significant number of green cards, you can add a `HAVING` clause:

```sql
-- Same query but only for sets with at least 10 green cards
SELECT 
    cs.SetName,
    cs.SetCode,
    cs.ReleaseDate,
    COUNT(*) as GreenCardCount,
    ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 2) as AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
JOIN Color col ON cc.ColorID = col.ColorID
WHERE col.Color = 'Green'
AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cs.SetID, cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;
```

Would you like me to suggest any variations of this query or help you explore other aspects of your MTG database?

```sql
-- Find average converted mana cost for green cards by set
SELECT 
    cs.SetName,
    cs.SetCode,
    cs.ReleaseDate,
    COUNT(*) as GreenCardCount,
    ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 2) as AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
JOIN Color col ON cc.ColorID = col.ColorID
WHERE col.Color = 'Green'
AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cs.SetID, cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;
```

```shellscript
cd /Users/jankmajesty/Desktop/dbProj/mtgdb
```

```shellscript
sqlite3 mtg_database.db
```

```sql
.headers on
.mode column
```

```sql
-- Same query but only for sets with at least 10 green cards
SELECT 
    cs.SetName,
    cs.SetCode,
    cs.ReleaseDate,
    COUNT(*) as GreenCardCount,
    ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 2) as AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
JOIN Color col ON cc.ColorID = col.ColorID
WHERE col.Color = 'Green'
AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cs.SetID, cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;
```

**User**

there waas no output from the select statement

---

**Cursor**

The query returned no output, which suggests there might be an issue with how the color data is stored or the query structure. Let me help you debug this step by step.

First, let's check what data actually exists in your database. Run these diagnostic queries one by one:

## 1. Check if there are any cards at all:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as TotalCards FROM Card;
```

## 2. Check what colors exist in the Color table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Color;
```

## 3. Check if there are any color associations:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as ColorAssociations FROM Card_Color;
```

## 4. Check a sample of cards with their basic info:
```sql
SELECT CardID, CardName, ManaCost, ConvertedManaCost 
FROM Card 
WHERE ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 5;
```

## 5. Check if there are any entries in Card_Color with sample data:
```sql
SELECT cc.CardID, cc.ColorID, c.CardName 
FROM Card_Color cc
JOIN Card c ON cc.CardID = c.CardID
LIMIT 5;
```

## 6. Try to find green cards with a more flexible approach:
```sql
-- Check if 'Green' is stored with different capitalization
SELECT DISTINCT Color FROM Color 
WHERE Color LIKE '%green%' OR Color LIKE '%Green%' OR Color LIKE '%GREEN%';
```

## 7. If green cards exist, try a simpler query first:
```sql
-- Just count green cards without the set join
SELECT COUNT(*) as GreenCards
FROM Card c
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
JOIN Color col ON cc.ColorID = col.ColorID
WHERE col.Color = 'Green';
```

Run these queries in order and let me know what output you get. This will help us identify where the issue is:

- Are there cards in the database?
- Are there colors defined?
- Are cards properly linked to colors?
- Is 'Green' the correct spelling/capitalization?

Based on what you find, I can then adjust the query accordingly.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as TotalCards FROM Card;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM Color;
```

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as ColorAssociations FROM Card_Color;
```

```sql
SELECT CardID, CardName, ManaCost, ConvertedManaCost 
FROM Card 
WHERE ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 5;
```

```sql
SELECT cc.CardID, cc.ColorID, c.CardName 
FROM Card_Color cc
JOIN Card c ON cc.CardID = c.CardID
LIMIT 5;
```

```sql
-- Check if 'Green' is stored with different capitalization
SELECT DISTINCT Color FROM Color 
WHERE Color LIKE '%green%' OR Color LIKE '%Green%' OR Color LIKE '%GREEN%';
```

```sql
-- Just count green cards without the set join
SELECT COUNT(*) as GreenCards
FROM Card c
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
JOIN Color col ON cc.ColorID = col.ColorID
WHERE col.Color = 'Green';
```

**User**

I think to find green cards we need to match the colorID to the card

---

**Cursor**

Exactly right! I see the issue now. The colors are stored as single letters (W, U, B, R, G) rather than full names. Green cards have ColorID = 2, which corresponds to 'G' in the Color table.

Let's fix the query to use the correct ColorID for green cards:

```sql
-- Find average converted mana cost for green cards by set (using ColorID = 2 for Green)
SELECT 
    cs.SetName,
    cs.SetCode,
    cs.ReleaseDate,
    COUNT(*) as GreenCardCount,
    ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 2) as AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
WHERE cc.ColorID = 2  -- Green cards (G)
AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cs.SetID, cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;
```

Or if you prefer to be more explicit and still use the Color table join:

```sql
-- Alternative version that joins with Color table for clarity
SELECT 
    cs.SetName,
    cs.SetCode,
    cs.ReleaseDate,
    COUNT(*) as GreenCardCount,
    ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 2) as AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
JOIN Color col ON cc.ColorID = col.ColorID
WHERE col.Color = 'G'  -- Using 'G' instead of 'Green'
AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cs.SetID, cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;
```

For reference, the color mappings in your database are:
- W = White (ColorID = 1)
- G = Green (ColorID = 2) 
- B = Black (ColorID = 3)
- U = Blue (ColorID = 4)
- R = Red (ColorID = 5)

Try either version of the corrected query and you should see results now!

```sql
-- Find average converted mana cost for green cards by set (using ColorID = 2 for Green)
SELECT 
    cs.SetName,
    cs.SetCode,
    cs.ReleaseDate,
    COUNT(*) as GreenCardCount,
    ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 2) as AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
WHERE cc.ColorID = 2  -- Green cards (G)
AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cs.SetID, cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;
```

```sql
-- Alternative version that joins with Color table for clarity
SELECT 
    cs.SetName,
    cs.SetCode,
    cs.ReleaseDate,
    COUNT(*) as GreenCardCount,
    ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 2) as AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
JOIN Color col ON cc.ColorID = col.ColorID
WHERE col.Color = 'G'  -- Using 'G' instead of 'Green'
AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cs.SetID, cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;
```

**User**

now can we find the average converted mana cost for red cards across sets?

---

**Cursor**

Absolutely! For red cards, you'll want to use ColorID = 5 (which corresponds to 'R' in your Color table). Here's the query:

```sql
-- Find average converted mana cost for red cards by set
SELECT 
    cs.SetName,
    cs.SetCode,
    cs.ReleaseDate,
    COUNT(*) as RedCardCount,
    ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 2) as AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
WHERE cc.ColorID = 5  -- Red cards (R)
AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cs.SetID, cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;
```

Or using the Color table join for clarity:

```sql
-- Alternative version with explicit Color table join
SELECT 
    cs.SetName,
    cs.SetCode,
    cs.ReleaseDate,
    COUNT(*) as RedCardCount,
    ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 2) as AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
JOIN Color col ON cc.ColorID = col.ColorID
WHERE col.Color = 'R'  -- Red cards
AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cs.SetID, cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;
```

This will show you the average converted mana cost for red cards in each set, ordered from highest to lowest average mana cost. You'll see which sets have the most expensive red cards on average!

If you want to compare red vs green, you could also run both queries and compare the results, or create a combined query that shows both colors side by side.

```sql
-- Find average converted mana cost for red cards by set
SELECT 
    cs.SetName,
    cs.SetCode,
    cs.ReleaseDate,
    COUNT(*) as RedCardCount,
    ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 2) as AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
WHERE cc.ColorID = 5  -- Red cards (R)
AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cs.SetID, cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;
```

```sql
-- Alternative version with explicit Color table join
SELECT 
    cs.SetName,
    cs.SetCode,
    cs.ReleaseDate,
    COUNT(*) as RedCardCount,
    ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 2) as AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
JOIN Color col ON cc.ColorID = col.ColorID
WHERE col.Color = 'R'  -- Red cards
AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cs.SetID, cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;
```

**User**

I want to round the average to the nearest decimal

---

**Cursor**

To round to the nearest whole number (no decimal places), just change the ROUND function from 2 decimal places to 0:

```sql
-- Find average converted mana cost for red cards by set (rounded to nearest whole number)
SELECT 
    cs.SetName,
    cs.SetCode,
    cs.ReleaseDate,
    COUNT(*) as RedCardCount,
    ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 0) as AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
WHERE cc.ColorID = 5  -- Red cards (R)
AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cs.SetID, cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;
```

Or if you want to round to 1 decimal place:

```sql
-- Rounded to 1 decimal place
ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 1) as AvgManaCost
```

The `ROUND(value, digits)` function works where:
- `digits = 0` → rounds to nearest whole number (3.7 becomes 4)
- `digits = 1` → rounds to 1 decimal place (3.67 becomes 3.7)
- `digits = 2` → rounds to 2 decimal places (3.676 becomes 3.68)

```sql
-- Find average converted mana cost for red cards by set (rounded to nearest whole number)
SELECT 
    cs.SetName,
    cs.SetCode,
    cs.ReleaseDate,
    COUNT(*) as RedCardCount,
    ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 0) as AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
WHERE cc.ColorID = 5  -- Red cards (R)
AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cs.SetID, cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;
```

```sql
-- Rounded to 1 decimal place
ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 1) as AvgManaCost
```

**User**

can we do this for the green cards?

---

**Cursor**

Absolutely! Here's the query for green cards with the average rounded to the nearest whole number:

```sql
-- Find average converted mana cost for green cards by set (rounded to nearest whole number)
SELECT 
    cs.SetName,
    cs.SetCode,
    cs.ReleaseDate,
    COUNT(*) as GreenCardCount,
    ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 0) as AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
WHERE cc.ColorID = 2  -- Green cards (G)
AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cs.SetID, cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;
```

This will show you the average converted mana cost for green cards in each set, rounded to the nearest whole number, ordered from highest to lowest average mana cost.

```sql
-- Find average converted mana cost for green cards by set (rounded to nearest whole number)
SELECT 
    cs.SetName,

**User**

can we do this for the blue cards?

---

**Cursor**

Absolutely! Here's the query for blue cards with the average rounded to the nearest whole number:

```sql
-- Find average converted mana cost for blue cards by set (rounded to nearest whole number)
SELECT 
    cs.SetName,
    cs.SetCode,
    cs.ReleaseDate,
    COUNT(*) as BlueCardCount,
    ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 0) as AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
WHERE cc.ColorID = 4  -- Blue cards (U)
AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cs.SetID, cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;
```

This will show you the average converted mana cost for blue cards in each set, rounded to the nearest whole number, ordered from highest to lowest average mana cost.

Remember: Blue is represented as 'U' in Magic (to avoid confusion with Black 'B'), so it has ColorID = 4 in your database.

```sql
-- Find average converted mana cost for blue cards by set (rounded to nearest whole number)
SELECT 
    cs.SetName,
    cs.SetCode,
    cs.ReleaseDate,
    COUNT(*) as BlueCardCount,
    ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 0) as AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
WHERE cc.ColorID = 4  -- Blue cards (U)
AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cs.SetID, cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;
```

**User**

can we do this for the white cards?

---

**Cursor**

Absolutely! Here's the query for white cards with the average rounded to the nearest whole number:

```sql
-- Find average converted mana cost for white cards by set (rounded to nearest whole number)
SELECT 
    cs.SetName,
    cs.SetCode,
    cs.ReleaseDate,
    COUNT(*) as WhiteCardCount,
    ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 0) as AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
WHERE cc.ColorID = 1  -- White cards (W)
AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cs.SetID, cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;
```

This will show you the average converted mana cost for white cards in each set, rounded to the nearest whole number, ordered from highest to lowest average mana cost.

White cards use ColorID = 1 (represented as 'W' in your Color table).

```sql
-- Find average converted mana cost for white cards by set (rounded to nearest whole number)
SELECT 
    cs.SetName,
    cs.SetCode,
    cs.ReleaseDate,
    COUNT(*) as WhiteCardCount,
    ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 0) as AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
WHERE cc.ColorID = 1  -- White cards (W)
AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cs.SetID, cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;
```

**User**

can we do this for the black cards?

---

**Cursor**

Absolutely! Here's the query for black cards with the average rounded to the nearest whole number:

```sql
-- Find average converted mana cost for black cards by set (rounded to nearest whole number)
SELECT 
    cs.SetName,
    cs.SetCode,
    cs.ReleaseDate,
    COUNT(*) as BlackCardCount,
    ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 0) as AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
WHERE cc.ColorID = 3  -- Black cards (B)
AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cs.SetID, cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;

This will show you the average converted mana cost for black cards in each set, rounded to the nearest whole number, ordered from highest to lowest average mana cost.

Black cards use ColorID = 3 (represented as 'B' in your Color table).

```sql
-- Find average converted mana cost for black cards by set (rounded to nearest whole number)
SELECT 
    cs.SetName,
    cs.SetCode,
    cs.ReleaseDate,
    COUNT(*) as BlackCardCount,
    ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 0) as AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
WHERE cc.ColorID = 3  -- Black cards (B)
AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cs.SetID, cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;
```

can we get the average converted mana cost for rare cards by color?

---

**Cursor**

Absolutely! Here's a query that shows the average converted mana cost for rare cards broken down by color:

```sql
-- Find average converted mana cost for rare cards by color
SELECT 
    col.Color,
    COUNT(*) as RareCardCount,
    ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 0) as AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN Rarity r ON c.RarityID = r.RarityID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
JOIN Color col ON cc.ColorID = col.ColorID
WHERE r.RarityName = 'rare'
AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY col.ColorID, col.Color
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;
```

This will show you:
- **Color**: The color (W, U, B, R, G)
- **RareCardCount**: How many rare cards of that color exist
- **AvgManaCost**: Average converted mana cost for rare cards of that color

If the rarity might be stored with different capitalization, you could also try:

```sql
-- Alternative with case-insensitive rarity matching
SELECT 
    col.Color,
    COUNT(*) as RareCardCount,
    ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 0) as AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN Rarity r ON c.RarityID = r.RarityID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
JOIN Color col ON cc.ColorID = col.ColorID
WHERE LOWER(r.RarityName) = 'rare'
AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY col.ColorID, col.Color
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;
```

This will tell you which colors tend to have the most expensive rare cards on average!

```sql
-- Find average converted mana cost for rare cards by color
SELECT 
    col.Color,
    COUNT(*) as RareCardCount,
    ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 0) as AvgManaCost

**User**

I would like to remove the '//' type. Those cards can be identified by layout.

---

**Cursor**

You can exclude the split “//” cards by filtering out rows where `Card.Layout = 'split'`. Add this condition to your existing queries.

Example (avg CMC for green by set, rounded, excluding split):
```sql
SELECT 
  cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate,
  COUNT(*) AS GreenCardCount,
  ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 0) AS AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
WHERE cc.ColorID = 2
  AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(COALESCE(c.Layout, '')) <> 'split'
GROUP BY cs.SetID, cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;
```

Use the same extra predicate for other queries:
- Add `AND LOWER(COALESCE(c.Layout, '')) <> 'split'` to the WHERE clause.

If you actually want to remove split cards from the database:
```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
DELETE FROM Card WHERE LOWER(Layout) = 'split';
``` 

- Excluding split layout via `LOWER(COALESCE(c.Layout, '')) <> 'split'` will filter out “//” cards in any SELECT.
- Optional: permanent removal with `DELETE FROM Card WHERE LOWER(Layout) = 'split'`.

```sql
SELECT 
  cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate,
  COUNT(*) AS GreenCardCount,
  ROUND(AVG(c.ConvertedManaCost), 0) AS AvgManaCost
FROM Card c
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
JOIN Card_Color cc ON c.CardID = cc.CardID
WHERE cc.ColorID = 2
  AND c.ConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(COALESCE(c.Layout, '')) <> 'split'
GROUP BY cs.SetID, cs.SetName, cs.SetCode, cs.ReleaseDate
ORDER BY AvgManaCost DESC;
```

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
DELETE FROM Card WHERE LOWER(Layout) = 'split';
```

**User**

I want to keep the split cards in the db. I just want to remove '//' from types.

---

**Cursor**

I'll look into how types are stored and where '//' might be coming from in your code, so I can suggest a clean way to strip it from types without deleting split cards.

I'll update the parser to strip '//' from types across split faces and clean existing '//' entries from your database so future inserts and current data are both corrected. Running the changes and cleanup now.

I’m going to update your parser to strip the '//' token from types going forward and clean any existing '//' entries from `CardType` and `SubType` so your data is consistent. Then I’ll verify that no '//' entries remain.

- I updated `parse_type_line` in `main.py` to handle split faces and strip the literal `//` token. It now parses each face around `//`, merges supertypes/types/subtypes, and dedupes, so future inserts won’t create `//` as a type/subtype.
- I cleaned the database of any existing `//` entries in `CardType` and `SubType` (junction rows were cascaded).

You can verify there are no `//` types/subtypes left:
```sql
SELECT 'CardType //' AS what, COUNT(*) FROM CardType WHERE TypeName='//'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'SubType //', COUNT(*) FROM SubType WHERE SubTypeName='//';
```

- This keeps split cards in `Card` (no deletes from `Card`) and only removes the stray `//` category.
- New data loads will be clean; existing rows referencing `//` are removed.

- Edits: `main.py` `parse_type_line` now splits on `//`, ignores the token, and aggregates both faces. 
- DB cleanup: removed `//` rows from `CardType`/`SubType`; confirmed 0 remain.

```sql
SELECT 'CardType //' AS what, COUNT(*) FROM CardType WHERE TypeName='//'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'SubType //', COUNT(*) FROM SubType WHERE SubTypeName='//';
```

and how can i repopulate the db?

---

**Cursor**

To repopulate your database with the updated parser (that now handles '//' correctly), you can use your existing Python script. Here are a few options:

## Option 1: Complete Fresh Start (Recommended)
Delete the database file and run the script to rebuild everything:

---

**User**

I think i've got to run it using uv?

---

**Cursor**

You're absolutely right! Since you're using `uv` for dependency management, let me check your project setup and show you the correct way to run it.

Perfect! You do have `uv` installed. Since you have a `pyproject.toml` file with dependencies defined, you should use `uv` to run your script. Here are your options to repopulate the database:

## Option 1: Fresh start with uv (Recommended)
```bash
rm mtg_database.db && uv run python main.py
```

## Option 2: Clear existing data and repopulate
If you want to keep the database file but clear the data:
```bash
uv run python -c "
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('mtg_database.db')
conn.execute('DELETE FROM Card_SubType')
conn.execute('DELETE FROM Card_CardType') 
conn.execute('DELETE FROM Card_Color')
conn.execute('DELETE FROM Card')
conn.execute('DELETE FROM Artist')
conn.execute('DELETE FROM Rarity')
conn.execute('DELETE FROM CardSet')
conn.execute('DELETE FROM Color')
conn.execute('DELETE FROM CardType')
conn.execute('DELETE FROM SubType')
conn.commit()
conn.close()
" && uv run python main.py
```

## Option 3: Just run the script (if it handles duplicates)
```bash
uv run python main.py
```

Which approach would you prefer? The fresh start (Option 1) is usually cleanest and ensures your updated parser processes everything correctly.

```shellscript
rm mtg_database.db && uv run python main.py
```

```shellscript
uv run python -c "
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('mtg_database.db')
conn.execute('DELETE FROM Card_SubType')
conn.execute('DELETE FROM Card_CardType') 
conn.execute('DELETE FROM Card_Color')
conn.execute('DELETE FROM Card')
conn.execute('DELETE FROM Artist')
conn.execute('DELETE FROM Rarity')
conn.execute('DELETE FROM CardSet')
conn.execute('DELETE FROM Color')
conn.execute('DELETE FROM CardType')
conn.execute('DELETE FROM SubType')
conn.commit()
conn.close()
" && uv run python main.py
```

```shellscript
uv run python main.py
```

how do i find the total number of cards in my db?

---

**Cursor**

You can find the total number of cards in your database with this simple SQL query:

Let me try that again with proper formatting:

Let me try a different approach to get a clean result:

Perfect! I can see from the output that you have **636 cards** in your database.

You can also run this query directly in the SQLite shell for a cleaner experience:

1. Connect to SQLite:
```bash
sqlite3 mtg_database.db
```

2. Set up nice formatting:
```sql
.headers on
.mode column
```

3. Run the query:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as TotalCards FROM Card;
```

This will show you have 636 total cards in your MTG database. This is much smaller than the ~1900 you had before, which suggests you may have cleared some data or are working with a subset of the original data.

```shellscript
sqlite3 mtg_database.db
```

```sql
.headers on
.mode column
```

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as TotalCards FROM Card;
```

---

**User**

it says the total is 636 cards, but it should be 1908

---

**Cursor**

You're right! You should have 1908 cards but currently only have 636. This suggests that when we cleaned up the '//' entries, we may have accidentally removed more data than intended, or there was some other issue during the database operations.

Let's repopulate your database to get back to the full 1908 cards. Since you're using `uv`, here's how to do a fresh rebuild:

The script is now running in the background to repopulate your database. This will fetch all the cards from the Scryfall API for the sets you're targeting (Urza's block, Masques block, and Invasion block) and rebuild the database with the updated parser that properly handles '//' split cards.

You can check the progress by looking at the terminal output, or once it's finished, you can verify the count again with:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as TotalCards FROM Card;
```

The script should restore your database to the full 1908 cards, but now with the '//' tokens properly handled in the type parsing.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as TotalCards FROM Card;
```

---

**User**

still receiving only 636 cards

---

**Cursor**

I see the issue! Looking at the output, your script is only fetching cards from Urza's block (usg, ulg, uds) which gives you 636 cards total. But you mentioned you should have 1908 cards, which means you need to include the other blocks too.

Let me check what sets your script is configured to fetch:

Ah! I found the issue. Your script defaults to only fetching Urza's block (`--sets urzas`). To get all 1908 cards, you need to run it with the `--sets all` parameter to fetch from all three blocks (Urza's, Masques, and Invasion).

Let's run it with all sets:

Perfect! Now the script is running with `--sets all` which will fetch cards from:
- **Urza's block**: Urza's Saga, Urza's Legacy, Urza's Destiny (636 cards)
- **Masques block**: Mercadian Masques, Nemesis, Prophecy 
- **Invasion block**: Invasion, Planeshift, Apocalypse

This should give you the full 1908 cards. The script will take longer to run since it's fetching from all 9 sets instead of just the 3 Urza's sets.

You can monitor the progress and once it's complete, check the final count with:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as TotalCards FROM Card;
```

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as TotalCards FROM Card;
```

**User**

how can i select the cards spite/malice?

---

**Cursor**

To select the "Spite/Malice" card (which is a split card), you can use several approaches:

## Option 1: Search by exact card name
```sql
SELECT * FROM Card WHERE CardName = 'Spite // Malice';
```

## Option 2: Search using LIKE for partial matches
```sql
SELECT * FROM Card WHERE CardName LIKE '%Spite%' OR CardName LIKE '%Malice%';
```

## Option 3: Search for split cards specifically
```sql
SELECT * FROM Card WHERE Layout = 'split' AND (CardName LIKE '%Spite%' OR CardName LIKE '%Malice%');
```

## Option 4: Get detailed information with joins
```sql
SELECT 
    c.CardName,
    c.ManaCost,
    c.ConvertedManaCost,
    c.Layout,
    a.ArtistName,
    cs.SetName,
    cs.SetCode
FROM Card c
JOIN Artist a ON c.ArtistID = a.ArtistID
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
WHERE c.CardName LIKE '%Spite%' AND c.CardName LIKE '%Malice%';
```

Let me check what the actual card name looks like in your database:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Card WHERE CardName = 'Spite // Malice';
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM Card WHERE CardName LIKE '%Spite%' OR CardName LIKE '%Malice%';
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM Card WHERE Layout = 'split' AND (CardName LIKE '%Spite%' OR CardName LIKE '%Malice%');
```

```sql
SELECT 
    c.CardName,
    c.ManaCost,
    c.ConvertedManaCost,
    c.Layout,
    a.ArtistName,
    cs.SetName,
    cs.SetCode
FROM Card c
JOIN Artist a ON c.ArtistID = a.ArtistID
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
WHERE c.CardName LIKE '%Spite%' AND c.CardName LIKE '%Malice%';
```

Perfect! I can see that "Spite // Malice" is stored in your database with the `//` separator and has a `split` layout. Here's how to select it:

## The exact query for Spite // Malice:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Card WHERE CardName = 'Spite // Malice';
```

Or with better formatting:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Card WHERE CardName = 'Spite // Malice';
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM Card WHERE CardName = 'Spite // Malice';
```

Great! I can see the Spite // Malice card details:

- **CardName**: Spite // Malice
- **ManaCost**: {3}{U} // {3}{B} 
- **ConvertedManaCost**: 8.0
- **Layout**: split

So to select this card, you can use:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Card WHERE CardName = 'Spite // Malice';
```

The card has both faces represented in the mana cost (`{3}{U} // {3}{B}`) and the total converted mana cost is 8.0 (combining both halves: 4 + 4 = 8).

If you want to see more details about the card with related information:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.CardName,
    c.ManaCost,
    c.ConvertedManaCost,
    c.Layout,
    c.Abilities,
    a.ArtistName,
    cs.SetName
FROM Card c
JOIN Artist a ON c.ArtistID = a.ArtistID
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
WHERE c.CardName = 'Spite // Malice';
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM Card WHERE CardName = 'Spite // Malice';
```

```sql
SELECT 
    c.CardName,
    c.ManaCost,
    c.ConvertedManaCost,
    c.Layout,
    c.Abilities,
    a.ArtistName,
    cs.SetName
FROM Card c
JOIN Artist a ON c.ArtistID = a.ArtistID
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
WHERE c.CardName = 'Spite // Malice';
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM Card WHERE CardName = 'Spite // Malice';
```

```sql
SELECT 
    c.CardName,
    c.ManaCost,
    c.ConvertedManaCost,
    c.Layout,
    c.Abilities,
    a.ArtistName,
    cs.SetName
FROM Card c
JOIN Artist a ON c.ArtistID = a.ArtistID
JOIN CardSet cs ON c.SetID = cs.SetID
WHERE c.CardName = 'Spite // Malice';
```
