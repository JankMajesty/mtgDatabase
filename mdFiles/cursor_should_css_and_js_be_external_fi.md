would it be better to store the css and js in their own files outside of the html?

### Short answer
Yes—separating CSS and JS into their own files is usually better.

### Why
- **Maintainability**: Easier to read, debug, and organize.
- **Caching/performance**: Browsers cache static files across page loads.
- **Reusability**: Share styles/scripts across multiple templates.
- **Security**: Easier to adopt a strict Content Security Policy (avoid inline scripts).

### How to do it in your Flask app
1. Create:
   - `mtgDatabase/static/css/styles.css`
   - `mtgDatabase/static/js/app.js`
2. Move the contents of your `<style>...</style>` to `styles.css` and `<script>...</script>` to `app.js`.
3. In `templates/index.html`, reference them:

```html
<!-- in <head> -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='css/styles.css') }}">

<!-- before </body> -->
<script src="{{ url_for('static', filename='js/app.js') }}" defer></script>
```

Notes:
- `url_for('static', ...)` generates the correct static path.
- Use `defer` so scripts don’t block rendering.
- For cache-busting, you can append a version like `?v=1` or use an asset pipeline later.

### When inline is still fine
- **Critical CSS**: Small above‑the‑fold styles for faster first paint.
- **Tiny prototypes/single file demos**.
- **Emails** (CSS often must be inline).

If you want, I can split your current `templates/index.html` into `static/css/styles.css` and `static/js/app.js` and update the template for you. Just say go. 

- Moved recommendation: keep CSS/JS in `static/` and reference with `url_for('static', ...)`.
- Provided example links and minimal setup, including `defer` and cache-busting tip.
- Highlighted exceptions (critical CSS, prototypes, emails).

```html
<!-- in <head> -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='css/styles.css') }}">

<!-- before </body> -->
<script src="{{ url_for('static', filename='js/app.js') }}" defer></script>
```
